# User Guide

## What is Centabit?

Centabit is a modern budgeting application designed to help you:

### Key Features

#### 📊 BAR (Budget Adherence Ratio)
A unique metric that compares your spending rate to time progression. BAR helps you understand if you're on track to stay within budget.

- **BAR > 1.0**: You're spending faster than time is passing (⚠️ slow down!)
- **BAR ≈ 1.0**: You're perfectly on track (✅ great job!)
- **BAR < 1.0**: You're spending slower than time is passing (🎉 ahead of schedule!)

Learn more in our detailed [Understanding BAR guide](./understanding-bar.md).

4. **Set Category Allocations**:

## Tips for Success

### 1. Set Realistic Budgets
Start with actual spending data from your bank statements. Don't set budgets that are too restrictive - you'll get discouraged.

### 2. Track Regularly
Add transactions daily or weekly. The more current your data, the more useful your BAR metric becomes.

### 3. Use Categories Effectively
Assign every transaction to a category. This helps you understand spending patterns and identify areas to cut back.

### 4. Review Your BAR Weekly
Check in on your Budget Adherence Ratio at least once a week. Adjust spending if you notice BAR creeping above 1.0.

### 5. Adjust Allocations as Needed
If you consistently overspend in one category and underspend in another, adjust your allocations to match reality.
